Overview:
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game of chess, programmed in Java. The game adheres to the standard rules of chess, with the additional requirement that players input the coordinates into the console of the chess pieces they wish to move and the coordinates they wish to move the piece to.
How to Play
Setup: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile: Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
Run: Run the compiled Java program.
Gameplay: Follow the prompts to input the coordinates of the chess piece you'd like to move and the coordinates you'd like to move the piece to. For example, input “A,2 B,4” to move a piece from position (A,2) to position (B,4).
Rules: The game follows the standard rules of chess, where players take turns moving their pieces according to the specific rules of each piece.
